# Spending Tracker Cross Platform Front End

This small application written in [Python](https://python.org) and [Kivy](https://kivy.org) helps you **track your expenses**.
You can clone it, build your own instance for many platforms [supported by Kivy](https://kivy.org/#download) and you'll be able to track your expenses *without any major (or minor) company monitoring what you spend your money on*.

> You can find the corresponding back end application [here](https://github.com/janos-gonye/spending-tracker-api).

#### What you can do with it
 - Create categories and subcategories of any category.
 - Add transactions to categories.
 - Show statistics and export it to JSON format which sent automatically to your registered email address.
 - Users can register by email address which must be confirmed. So your friends, family members or girlfriend can use it, too.

> *Please note, it's just a hobby project, not an enterprise application.*  
> *Though, I think you knew this... :-)*
